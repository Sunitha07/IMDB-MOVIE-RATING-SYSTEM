This project focuses on predicting IMDb movie ratings using various attributes like director name, actors, budget, gross earnings, and more. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, such as the number of critic reviews, movie duration, Facebook likes of actors/directors, movie budget, and genres. The first step involves **data preprocessing** to handle missing values, where missing numerical values are imputed with either the mean or median, and missing categorical values are filled with the mode or a placeholder value like "Unknown." We then apply **feature selection**, choosing attributes like genres, actor and director Facebook likes, budget, and gross earnings, as these are likely to influence movie ratings. Categorical data, such as genres and languages, are encoded using **one-hot encoding** or **label encoding** to convert them into numerical values. Additionally, numerical features like budget and gross earnings are **scaled** to ensure uniformity in the data. After preprocessing, we select a **regression model**, such as linear regression or decision trees, to predict the IMDb rating, a continuous target variable. The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance, using metrics like **mean squared error (MSE)** and **R-squared** to assess accuracy. To improve the model, techniques like **cross-validation** or **feature importance analysis** can be applied to determine which features most strongly impact the rating. The final model allows us to predict movie ratings based on selected attributes, providing insights into how factors like budget, actor popularity, and genre affect the success of a film. This project not only offers predictive capabilities but also aids in understanding the elements that contribute to higher or lower movie ratings.
